1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,319
something a lot deeper
there that you think looks

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,129
like, oh my God, wow,
I want to be them.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,679
No, there's always something
that, you know, I kind of

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,529
like feel a bit for them.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,319
Cause I'm like, there's a
reason they're seeking the

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,609
validation, the attention.

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,308
And I think that we need to
recognize that as individuals.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,278
We don't have to be the
loudest in the room to be

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,889
the most confident at all.

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,889
Yeah, absolutely.

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,839
And just to kind of circle
back to your album of wins,

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,509
I'm glad you brought up
for the less visual people.

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,229
because I think I'm more
like written word style.

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,389
I have an Excel sheet, which
is very corporate of me.

15
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,999
But it's just because it's
kind of tied in with a

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,549
couple other things I'm
tracking, so to speak.

17
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,609
But I have like a wins list.

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,859
And so whenever something
happens big or small

19
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,469
doesn't matter.

20
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,789
I'll put it on the list.

21
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,729
And again, it's something I
can go back and reflect on.

22
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,469
And the best part about
doing this, whether you pick
